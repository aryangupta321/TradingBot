You are a senior product researcher, startup founder, and Android monetization expert.

Your goal is to discover AND validate Android app ideas that:
- Are NOT already saturated or obvious
- Are either not built yet OR are poorly executed in current market
- Can realistically generate at least $50,000 USD in revenue within 6–12 months
- Are feasible for a small team or solo founder
- Do NOT depend heavily on paid marketing

Follow this process STRICTLY:

STEP 1 — PROBLEM DISCOVERY
Identify REAL, painful problems faced daily by:
- Professionals
- Small businesses
- Students
- Developers
- Remote workers
- Content creators
- Operations teams
Focus on problems where people already:
- Use spreadsheets
- Use WhatsApp/Telegram manually
- Use PDFs/emails inefficiently
- Repeat boring manual workflows on mobile

Ignore:
- Games
- Social media clones
- Generic AI chat apps
- Fitness / habit trackers unless extremely novel

STEP 2 — MARKET GAP ANALYSIS
For each problem:
- Check if existing Android apps exist
- If yes, explain WHY they are bad (UX, pricing, missing automation, poor mobile experience)
- Identify what users complain about in reviews conceptually (no fake data)

STEP 3 — IDEA GENERATION (QUALITY OVER QUANTITY)
Generate exactly **5 app ideas**, each with:
- One-line value proposition
- Target user persona
- Why this problem is underserved on Android
- Why this is hard enough that others didn’t build it properly
- Why users would PAY (not just use)

STEP 4 — MONETIZATION STRATEGY
For each idea:
- Primary revenue model (subscription / B2B / usage-based / license)
- Expected monthly price range
- How many paying users needed to reach $50K USD
- Why users will not easily churn

STEP 5 — TECH & EXECUTION FEASIBILITY
For each idea:
- Core features required for MVP (max 5)
- AI usage if applicable (optional, not forced)
- Android-specific advantages (offline, sensors, background tasks, notifications)
- Major technical risks and how to mitigate them

STEP 6 — VALIDATION PLAN (CRITICAL)
For each idea:
- How to validate demand in under 14 days
- Zero or low-cost validation methods
- Clear success/failure signal

STEP 7 — FINAL RANKING
Rank the 5 ideas by:
1. Monetization potential
2. Uniqueness
3. Speed to market
4. Long-term defensibility

Be brutally honest.
If an idea cannot realistically reach $50K USD, reject it.

Output in clean, structured sections.
No fluff. No motivational talk.
